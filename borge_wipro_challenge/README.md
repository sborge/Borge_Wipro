# Agile Trailblazers Coding Excercise description.

This exercise is intended to take 3 to 4 hours and assumes you are well versed in building Android Native Applications. For this exercise, you are required to build a simple Android Native App. Prior to your interview please submit your source code back to AgileTrailblazers.

As a user, I want to be able to search by Zip Code for my local weather conditions.

## Running the demo

You can do this in two different ways:

### Install the app

Go to \app\build\outputs\apk and run

```
adb install app-debug.apk
```

### Run it from Android Studio

Clone the project to your local typing from the command line:

```
git clone https://github.com/bryios167/agile_trailblazers_challenge.git
```

Import the project into your Android Studio with the option

```
file > open
```

And then selecting this cloned project (select and open the agile_trailblazers_challenge folder).
