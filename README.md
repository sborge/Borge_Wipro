Run the project using Android Studio, you can use the written test for the Zip code to test its functionality. 
I would have written more tests given more time. Additionally, given more time, I would have improved the UI/UX 
and added support for landscape viewing. I would also add all of the information given by the API (details about every
3 hours istead of a single view once a day at noon).
